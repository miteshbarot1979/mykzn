Arrays in PHP
==================

if we want to save multiple values in a single variable, we can use an array


What is an array?
===================
An array is a collection of elements of semilar or different data types

create an array
=================

$variable = ['value1',"value2",.....];

or

$variable = array("value1","value2",....)


$arr = [10,20,30,40];

$subjects = ["HTML","CSS","BootStrap","JavaScript","PHP",'MySQL'];

$mix = [10,32.32,true,"Welcome"];

$subjects[3]



Types of arrays
==================

indexed arrays
====================
The arrays which are created with numerical indexes are called indexed arrays

Associative Arrays
===================
The arrays which are created with named indexes are called associative arrays


$variable = [ "key1" => "value1", "key2" => "value2",.... ];

$user = [
	"name" => "Ram",
	"city" => "Hyderabad",
	"state" => "TS",
	"pincode" => 500032,
];











in c, c++, java
==============
An array is a collection of elements of semilar data type


variable
=========
a variable is used to save some value
only one value we can store in a variable


foreach loop
==============
by using foreach loop we can iterate the indexed arrays and associative arrays also

for loop
=========
by using for loop we can iterate the indexed arrays only




foreach(array as $key => $value)
{
	echo $key;
	echo $value;
}


both methods are used for sorting array values only
sort - ASC
rsort - DESC
===================================================
both methods are used for sorting array keys only
ksort - ASC
krsort - DESC


array_combine
===============
Both parameters should have an equal number of elements
expects exactly 2 parameters

array_merge
===============
Both parameters should have an different number of elements
expects exactly more than two parameters


array_push - adding an elements into an array at last position
array_unshift - adding an elements into an array at first position

array_ pop - removes the last element from an array
array_shift - removes the first element from an array
