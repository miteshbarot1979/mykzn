Variables in PHP
====================
what is a variable?

A variable is a container that can store a value

A variable can be reusable every where in our file

c = 100;

varying => changing the value


variables are declared by using $ symbol

in PHP, while declaring the variables, we no need to mention the datatype

$c = 10; => $c = "Hello";
$f = 10.5;

$firstname = "Ram";
$lastname = "Babburi";


echo
========

1. using echo statement we can print the multiple variables with comma separated, where as by using print we can not

2. print statement will always returns true after printing the output. where as echo statement does not return any value
