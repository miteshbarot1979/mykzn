Object Oriented PHP
=====================

The Primary template of OOP is a Class


What is a class?
================
A Class is collection of Properties and Methods

propertis are nothing but variables

methods are nothing but functions


A class will always groups something(props and methods) togeather


A class is used to resue the logic 


Real Life
==========

PHP Class Room
===============
collection of students and chairs

Students ==> Methods ==> it's a TASK | Function | Work |

Chairs ===> Properties


collection of propertis and methods




in a class room

students are using chairs ? ==>Yes

or

chairs are using students? NO



Some times the class propertis may depends upon the Methods

or

Some times the method execution may depends upon the properties


The state of the class will depends upon the  properties

The Behaviour/Functionality of the class depends upon the methods

Employee
	AddEmp
	DeleteEmp
	EditEmp
	UpdateEmp
	BlockEmp

How to create a class?
==========================
by using class keyword, we can create a class


class <class-name>
{
	// some properties
	// some methods
}

class <class-name>
{
	// methods
}

class <class-name>
{
	// Properties
}


class <class-name>
{
}


In class, the properties are declared by using access specifiers ==> public, private, protected


How can we access the class members(Properties + Methods)?
==========================================================

By using an Object


Why should i create an object?
====================================
Ans: to access the class members


What will happen if i create an object?
=======================================
by creating an object the class members(props + Methods) will get Memory allocated...


What is an Object?
=====================
an object is an Instance of a class or an object is a blueprint/xerox cpoy of a class


What is meant by instance of a class?
======================================
instance/instantiation is nothing but allocating memory to the class members


How can i create an Object?
=============================

By using new keyword with class

$obj = new ClassName();


Generally, there are two types of class members(properties + Methods)

1. Non-Static Members
=========================
The class members which are declared WITHOUT static keyword are callled non-static members

Non-Static members gets memory allocated at the time of object creation

Non-Static members are always accessed by using an object.

We can not access the static members with object

if we want to execute some logic at the time of object creation, we can go for Non-Static members


2. Static Members
===========================
The class members which are declared with static keyword are callled non-static members

We can not access the static members of a class by using an Object

Then how can we access the static members of a class?
by using class name with scope resolution operator(::)

Static members gets memory allocated at the time of class loading

if we want to execute some logic at the time of class loading, we can go for Static members


scope resolution operator(::)
=============================
By using this operator, we can access the static members of a class and Constants of a class also
