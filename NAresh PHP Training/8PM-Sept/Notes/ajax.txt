How to work with AJAX
========================

backbone of ajax is XMLHttpRequest Object, its predefined

1. create ajax Object

var obj = new XMLHttpRequest();

2. Sending request to serever

obj.send();

type of method => GET or POST

End Point URL ==> Request URL, to get the data

http://localhost/8pmsept/data.php

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users


request type => true | false

asynchronus request - true
============================
irctc.co.in at 11AM ==> Sending multiple requests to server without waiting for the response


synchronus request - false

ticket counter => One By One => Sending requests to server one by one

obj.open("GET","https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users", true);
obj.send();
