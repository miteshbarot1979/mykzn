Abstraction
=============
Abstraction is the process of hiding the logic.
Abstraction does not provide the logic. it will ask the sub classes to implement the logic

Abstraction will provides guidelines to the sub classes

Abstraction defines rules and regulations to the sub classes

Assignment
==============
Faculty: Print prime numbers between 2 and 20; ===> Abstraction

Student => Implement/Write the logic for the Assignment

Abstract classes are created with abstract keyword

An abstract class may contains an abstract method and normal methods or Non-abstract methods

Abstract method does not contains body => we can not write logic in abstract method

in abstract class normal methods can have logic

Can we create an object for abstract classes?

Ans: NO

Then how can we access the abstract class members?

Ans: BY inheriting them with sub classes or By creating sub class object


Interfaces
===========
Interfaces are also used to provide the guidelines the sub class members

An Interface contains only abstract methods.

If we want to provide strict rules and regulations to the sub class members we can use interfaces


interfaces are created by using interface keyword.


Can we create an object for interfaces?

Ans: NO

Then how can we access the Interface  members?

Ans: BY implement them with sub classes or By creating sub class object


Interfaces are implemented by the sub classes by using implements keyword


class extend class

class implements interface


All Interface methods are by default abstract, by default public

Interface methods also does not contains body
