$_FILES[][]
================

By using this variable, we get the uploaded file information


<input type="text" />
<input type="submit" />
<input type="file" /> display a choose file button

<form>
	<input type="file" />
</form>

By default an HTML form can transfer the plain text and html text only.

By default a form can not transfer media data

if we want to transfer some media data like images, audios, vidoes and moree.. through a form, we need to add an attribute the form is nothing but enctype with value multipart/form-data like below

 <form action="" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data"> 
 
 </form>
