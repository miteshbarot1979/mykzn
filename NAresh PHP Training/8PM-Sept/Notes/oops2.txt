How can we protect the class logic?
=====================================
By using private acess specifiers.


Access Specifiers
==================
Private: The class members which are declared with private access specifier, they can be accessed inside a class only.
Private members can not be accessed outside of a class and it's subclass

Protected: The class members which are declared with protected access specifier, they can be accessed inside a class only and its sub class also.
protected members can not be accessed outside of a class

Public:The class members which are declared with public access specifier, they can be accessed every where in the class, its sub classes and outside of a class also

Inheritance
===========
Inheritance is the process of acquiring the properties of a class into another class

Inheritance is the process of sharing the properties of a parent class into child class

Inheritance is implmented by using extends keyword



GF => 5L

F ===> 10L

Me ===> 15L


Polymorphism
=================

Ploy - many
morphs -> different forms
